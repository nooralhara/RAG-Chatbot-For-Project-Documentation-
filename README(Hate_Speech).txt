Hate-Speech-Detection-using-Bidirectional-LSTM
Overview
This project classifies tweets into three categories:
    1. Hate Speech.
    2. Offensive Language.
    3. Neither.
Three models were built, trained, and compared:
    1. Simple RNN.
    2. LSTM.
    3. Bidirectional LSTM.
Dataset
Davidson Hate Speech Dataset. around 25,000 labelled tweets. Heavily imbalanced towards "Offensive Language" class.
Data Pipeline
    1. Text Cleaning: lowercasing, URL/HTML Tag removal, punctuation stripping, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
    2. Tokenization & Padding: Keras Tokenizer with vocab size of 7000, sequences padding and truncated to length 40.
    3. Class Imbalance Handling: Combination of RandomOverSampling for minority classes and RandomUnderSampling for the majority class, with addition of class weights.
    4. Model Training: embedding layer trained from scratch, EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau callbacks.
    5. Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and confusion matrix for every model.
    6. Deployment: Chose the BiLSTM Model for deployment using streamlit.
Results
Class	Label	Precision	Recall	F1-score	Support
0	Hate Speech	0.31	0.62	0.41	286
1	Offensive Language	0.96	0.86	0.91	3,838
2	Neither	0.80	0.91	0.85	833
	Accuracy			0.85	4,957
	Macro avg	0.69	0.79	0.72	4,957
	Weighted avg	0.89	0.85	0.87	4,957

Numbers can change, this is only one singular instance of training and testing but other tries should give similar outputs
